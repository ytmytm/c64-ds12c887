LEGAL STUFF

This is freeware, but you may not remove the author's name and origin of
this software.

REQUIRED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

You need GEOS 2.0, 64 or 128 - doesn't matter.
You need DS12C887 RTC chip, but with minor modifications this code should
work with DS1687 RTC chip too (see rtclow.s for more info).

BUILD

Simply use included Makefile to build 'rtc.cvt' file - a file in Convert 2.5
format ready to be unconverted using Convert 2.5 or simply copied onto a
disk image with Star Commander.
A ready for use binary is included here in bin/ directory.

INSTRUCTION

This is auto-exec - place it on your boot disk to execute it every time you
run GEOS. If configured - the time and date will be set according to data
from RTC chip.

CONFIGURATION

When run for the first time, RTC-Setup will ask you for base address of the
RTC chip. The default value is D200 (that is, $D200), but you should supply
the correct address. If e.g. /RTC line is connected to /IO2 then your address
would be $DF00.
After that you will be asked for date and time. Enter them with leading zeros
(e.g. write '07' instead of '7').

If for some reason you made mistake in entering base address of RTC or it has
changed, you can change the configuration simply by entering the new address
in info field of file header. In DeskTop use file->info option from menu
while having RTC-Setup selected.
